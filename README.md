# A modified version of PETPrep-matlab for already-provided rCPS maps

This repository/codebase was used to prepare provided rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) derivative files into individually processed statistical maps per participant. It was built from a modified PETPrep-matlab pipeline to accommodate skipping some of the first steps since rCPS files were already provided to this pipeline and we did not want to re-create them.
